## Description

This application allows you to keep track of your money transactions. You can add or subtract transactions by inputting a name and amount that then gets added to a table. There is no functionality to delete said transactions so be mindful of what you add or subtract. As more and more transactions get added the line graph will keep track of your progress from transaction to transaction and day to day.

## My Contribution

The application itself was was a starter code provided to me. My job was to:

- add service workers and caches in conjunction with offline functionality
- add a web manifest that allows the user to add the app to their home screen of their phone
